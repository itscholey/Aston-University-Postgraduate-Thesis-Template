Write your abstract here. The \texttt{thesisabstract} environment will automatically format it according to the regulations and give the chapter a title. 

The thesis abstract is a concise description of the work 
undertaken and should contain reference to the problem to be 
addressed, the approach taken, the key results and conclusion. It must 
be written in English. All the information 
should be contained on one sheet of A4 paper unless two abstracts are required (see last sentence). The abstract itself should not exceed 300 words. If the student has obtained permission to submit the thesis in a foreign 
language, a translation of the abstract should also be provided.
