This is an example of how to use a margin comment.\comSide{This is a margin comment} If you wanted to add an in-line comment, you can use the following: \comPage{This is an inline comment.} Then you can carry on with normal text.\\


\noindent You can add quotes like this to your text:
\begin{quote}
The Quote environment is usually for short quotes.
\end{quote}

If you wanted something more lengthy, you can use the Quotation environment, as this keeps the indentation consistent:

\begin{quotation}
The Quotation environment can be used for longer quotes or passages of text. This is formatted differently to the Quote environment, as that does not indent the beginning of the quotation. The Quotation environment also has consistent indentation throughout.
\end{quotation}
