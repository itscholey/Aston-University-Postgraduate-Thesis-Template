\usepackage{todonotes} % enables comment bubbles for todo notes

\usepackage{siunitx} % for formatting scientific numbers (recommended as it makes rounding/changing how numbers are displayed easier)
\usepackage{hyperref} % styles hyperlinks (recommended)
\makeatletter\let\@bibitem\saved@bibitem\makeatother
    \hypersetup{
        colorlinks=false, % link is a box, link is coloured instead if true

%%%%%%%%%% Author Information %%%%%%%%%%

% Full name: Include all middle names if any
\fullname{Your Full Name}

% Initials: Include all initials with a full-stop after each, as well as lastname. IMPORTANT: add a tilde (~) between each initial/last name, as this provides the correct spacing and not the larger space that usually follows a fullstop

% Year: The year of submission
\thesisyear{2023}

% Formatted Thesis Sub-Title: Include your thesis sub-title here. Line breaks can be used to format the title in a visually appealling way, such as the example below. If a sub-title isn't used, leave {} blank

%%%%%%%%%% Comment Counters %%%%%%%%%%
% PLEASE READ: 

% Comment counters are an optional addition to this template. You can add both in-line and margin comments, and also personalise comments for the author and add more for supervisors if needed by duplicating the commands.

% To use comment counters, three things need to be changed if changing the command names or adding more:
        % Set up the counters (below)
        % Remove the comment word count from the total word count (below the counter setup)
        % Display the final count (thesis-statistics)
        
\newcounter{comSide}
\newcommand{\comSide}[1]{\stepcounter{comSide}%
    \todo[linecolor=black,backgroundcolor=yellow!30,bordercolor=orange,size=\scriptsize]{Comment: #1}}

\newcounter{comPage}
\newcommand{\comPage}[1]{\stepcounter{comPage}%    
    \todo[inline,linecolor=black,backgroundcolor=yellow!30,bordercolor=orange,size=\scriptsize]{Comment: #1}}

% These commands remove the todos from the word count, keep as comments
% Change the comment commands to your own if needed, or add more for any others you add
